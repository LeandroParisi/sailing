## About security.
Have you found the harnesses ?
If you are able to mount a cable I think it will work although I have not been able to test it myself. Another option is to buy a hand held vhf radio. It’s not to expensive. The reach is not more than a couple of kilometres but, it’s good to have when you enter new harbours, and it is better than nothing.
Normally Chanel 16 is the recomended Chanel if you find yourself in distress on the water.
If you need to take down the mast to do som installs in August I might be able to help you with that. (I’m not an expert in this regard, but I hare done it  a couple of times).

**About safety.** The most important thing ofcause is to avoid falling into the water. That means you can tie yourself up when you have to go on deck, or best, avoid going on deck.
Maybe you can find a used life raft on the internet, but I think it’s always the best solution to stay on the boat as long as possible.
